	5. House Control: 
		5.1. If the user is a renter, show them a list of all of their houses (a la Home page).
			When they click on a house in the list, redirect them to the "registration" page, where 
			they won't register a new house, but instead alter the specified one.
		5.2. When a user is registering a new house, allow them to upload more photos (How?)
	 
	6. PARTINALLY DONE - Refactor homeCtrl code
		Fix pagination so that it only shows at most 10 pages at a time. Format should be the following:
		|first||1||2||3||4||5||6||7||8||9||10||...||last|
							^

						     On click:
							Hide the first shown page and show 
							the next page

	7. DONE - Fix the css of the "Find House" page
